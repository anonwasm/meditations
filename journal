after having reviewed some, I think the 'test driven development' method seems to fit my personality, so aim to learn and use this method soon.

learn like you are 'on the job' in the 'real world', but make life difficult and figure out how to fix every issue along the way, and 
always be trying to do things better
and doing things sloppy rather than doing nothing
but finding better ways 

so! 

mainly use this anonwasm account, but also setup another environment, with Windows 10, a second github account/user, and he will be using VSCODE entirely, whereas on the anonwasm account I will be mostly using the fish shell / ubuntu terminal command line with some code 

ACCOUNT 1: Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS (Windows WSL2), mostly FISH shell, VIM 
anonwasm

ACCOUNT 2: Windows 10, mostly VSCODE, WSL2 fish terminal for linux practice, perhaps later to powershell for story consistency (?) (prioritising, for now, learning linux, since it is run from a windows machine anyways! WSL2 seems pretty great to me as a newbie)
